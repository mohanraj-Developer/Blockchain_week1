ETHEREUM WHITE PAPER

Title: A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform
 Author: Vitalik Buterin
 Year: 2013

1. What is the Ethereum White Paper?
The Ethereum White Paper is a technical document written by Vitalik Buterin that explains the idea of Ethereum, a blockchain platform designed not only for digital money but also for smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).
While Bitcoin focuses mainly on peer-to-peer digital currency, Ethereum focuses on programmable blockchain technology.

2. Problem with Existing Blockchain Systems (Bitcoin Limitations)
1.     Bitcoin scripting language is limited
2.     Difficult to build complex applications
3.     Not flexible for developers
4.     Blockchain used only for payments

3. Proposed Solution: Ethereum
Ethereum is proposed as a general-purpose blockchain that allows developers to create and run applications using smart contracts.
Core Idea:
Blockchain + Programming = Decentralized Applications

4. Key Concepts Explained in the Ethereum White Paper
4.1 Smart Contracts
·         Self-executing programs stored on the blockchain
·         Automatically run when conditions are met
·         No third-party involvement
4.2 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
·         A global decentralized computer
·         Executes smart contract code
·         Same results on all nodes
4.3 Ether (ETH)
·         Native cryptocurrency of Ethereum
·         Used to pay for transactions and computation
·         Acts as “fuel” for the network
4.4 Gas System
·         Measures computational cost
·         Prevents spam and infinite loops
·         Users pay gas fees in ETH
4.5 Accounts in Ethereum
Two types of accounts:
1.     Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) – controlled by private keys
2.     Contract Accounts – controlled by smart contract code

5. Ethereum Architecture
Decentralized peer-to-peer network
Public blockchain ledger
Uses cryptographic security
Originally used Proof of Work, now uses Proof of Stake

6. Use Cases Mentioned in the White Paper
Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
Token creation (ERC-20)
Decentralized exchanges
Supply chain tracking
Digital identity
Gaming and NFTs

7. Advantages of Ethereum
Highly programmable blockchain
Supports complex applications
Decentralized and secure
Large developer community
Foundation for Web3

8. Limitations Discussed
Scalability challenges
Gas fees can be high
Complexity for beginners

9. Importance of the Ethereum White Paper
Introduced smart contracts to blockchain
Enabled decentralized applications
Led to DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs
Expanded blockchain beyond currency

The Ethereum White Paper describes a blockchain platform that acts as a decentralized world computer, enabling anyone to build secure, transparent, and trustless applications without intermediaries.
