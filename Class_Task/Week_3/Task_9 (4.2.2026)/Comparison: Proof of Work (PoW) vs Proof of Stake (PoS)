Comparison: Proof of Work (PoW) vs Proof of Stake (PoS)

Aspect                        Proof of Work (PoW)                      Proof of Stake (PoS)
Basic Principle        Miners solve cryptographic puzzles        Validators stake coins to validate blocks
Resource Used          Computational power & electricity              Staked cryptocurrency
Block Creator          Miner with highest computing power        Validator selected based on stake
Energy Consumption                Very high                                 Very low
Hardware Requirement   Specialized hardware (ASICs, GPUs)                Normal servers
Security Model        Cost of attack is high due to energy cost  Cost of attack is loss of staked coins
51% Attack                Requires 51% of hash power                 Requires 51% of staked coins
Decentralization          Tends toward mining pools                  Can favor large stakeholders
Scalability               Lower throughput                           Higher throughput
Transaction Speed                  Slower                                    Faster
Environmental Impact      High carbon footprint                         Eco-friendly
Example Blockchains                Bitcoin                        Ethereum (after Merge), Cardano, Solana


One-Line Summary
PoW secures the network using computational work and energy.
PoS secures the network using economic stake and incentives.
