How a Transaction Becomes a Block (Step-by-Step)

1️. Transaction Creation
A user initiates a transaction by specifying the sender, receiver, amount, and signs it digitally using a private key.

2️. Transaction Broadcast
The signed transaction is broadcast to the blockchain network and shared with nearby nodes.

3. Transaction Verification
Network nodes verify the transaction by checking:
Digital signature validity
Sufficient balance
Transaction format and rules
Only valid transactions are accepted.

4️.Transaction Pool (Mempool)
Verified transactions are stored temporarily in a pool of unconfirmed transactions called the mempool.

5️. Block Formation
Miners (PoW) or validators (PoS) select multiple transactions from the mempool and group them into a block.

6️. Block Validation (Consensus)
PoW: Miners compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle.
PoS: A validator is selected based on stake to propose the block.

7️. Block Verification by Network
Other nodes verify the proposed block:
Transactions are valid
Block follows protocol rules
Block hash is correct

8️. Block Added to Blockchain
Once verified, the block is linked to the previous block using a cryptographic hash and added to the blockchain.

9️. Transaction Confirmation
The transaction is now confirmed. Additional blocks added later increase its confirmation count and security.

One-Line Summary (Exam Friendly)
A transaction becomes a block after it is verified, grouped with other transactions, validated through consensus
and permanently added to the blockchain.
