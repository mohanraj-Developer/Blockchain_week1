Bitcoin Mining: Definition, Process, and Global Distribution 

1. What is Bitcoin Mining

Bitcoin mining is the process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain using computational power. 
It operates under the Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism and secures the network while issuing new bitcoins as rewards.

Main purposes

Verify and confirm transactions
Secure the network
Prevent double spending
Add new blocks to the blockchain
Release new bitcoins into circulation


2. Bitcoin Mining Process:

1. Users send transactions to the network.
2. Miners verify transactions and group them into a block.
3. Miners compete to solve a cryptographic hash puzzle.
4. The first miner to solve it broadcasts the block.
5. Network nodes verify the block.
6. Block is added to the blockchain.
7. Miner receives block reward + transaction fees.

Average block time: ~10 minutes
Current block reward (2026): 3.125 BTC
Difficulty adjusts automatically based on total hash power
Most mining today is done through mining pools using specialized ASIC hardware.



3. Countries Involved in Bitcoin Mining (2026)

Bitcoin mining is concentrated in a small number of countries due to electricity cost, infrastructure, and regulation.

Country		            Estimated global hash rate share

United States			        35%–40%
China*			              15%–20%
Kazakhstan			          10%–13%
Russia				             8%–10%
Canada			               5%–7%
Paraguay		             	 3%–5%
UAE				                 3%–4%
Germany			               3%–4%
Malaysia			             2%–3%
Iran				               1%–2%
Others				             10%–15%


*Mining continues at reduced levels despite restrictions.
Total countries with notable mining:
Major mining hubs: ~10–15 countries
Smaller mining activity: 40+ countries



4. Regional Share of Mining

Region			Share
North America		40%–45%
Asia				20%–25%
Europe			15%–20%
Middle East			5%–7%
South America		5%–7%


5. Key Factors for Mining Location

Low electricity cost
Access to renewable or surplus energy
Cold climate
Supportive regulation
Data-center infrastructure


6. Summary

Bitcoin mining is the process of validating transactions and securing the blockchain through computational work. 
Miners solve cryptographic problems to add blocks and earn rewards. Mining activity exists in over 40 countries, 
but most global hash power is concentrated in about 10–15 countries, led by the United States, China, Kazakhstan, and Russia.
