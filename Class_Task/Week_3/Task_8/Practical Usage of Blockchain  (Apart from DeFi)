Practical Usage of Blockchain 
(Apart from DeFi)
1. Supply Chain Management
Track goods from origin to delivery
Prevent fraud and duplication
Improve transparency and trust
Example:
 Walmart uses blockchain to track food products and reduce contamination risks.

2. Digital Identity Management
Secure and verifiable digital identities
Users control their own identity data
Reduces identity theft
Example:
 Estonia’s e-Residency program uses blockchain for citizen identity.

3. Healthcare Records
Secure storage of medical data
Authorized access by hospitals and doctors
Prevents data tampering
Example:
 MedicalChain for patient record management.

4. Voting Systems
Transparent and tamper-proof voting
Reduces election fraud
Enables remote voting
Example:
 Blockchain-based e-voting pilots in West Virginia (USA).

5. Land & Property Registration
Immutable land ownership records
Prevents title fraud
Faster verification
Example:
 Land registry projects in India, Dubai, and Sweden.

6. Cross-Border Payments
Faster settlement compared to banks
Lower transaction costs
Transparent transaction history
Example:
 Ripple (XRP) used by banks for international transfers.

7. Education & Certificates
Verifiable academic certificates
Prevents fake degrees
Easy employer verification


Example:
 MIT issues blockchain-based digital certificates.

8. Intellectual Property & Copyright
Proof of ownership for digital content
Protects creators’ rights
Automated royalty distribution
Example:
 Music copyright platforms using blockchain for royalty tracking.


9. Government Records
Secure public records
Transparent governance
Reduced corruption
Example:
 Blockchain used for public records in Dubai’s smart government initiative.

10. IoT & Smart Devices
Secure communication between devices
No central control
Data integrity
Example:
 Blockchain for smart energy grids and device authentication.

Summary 
Blockchain is used beyond DeFi in supply chain, identity, healthcare, voting, land records, education, government systems, and IoT to ensure security, transparency, and immutability
