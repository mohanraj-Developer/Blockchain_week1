Consensus Algorithms in Blockchain
________________________________________
A consensus algorithm is a method used by blockchain networks to agree on the validity of transactions 
and blocks without a central authority.

1. Proof of Work (PoW)
•	Used in: Bitcoin
•	Miners solve complex mathematical puzzles
•	First miner to solve adds the block
•	Very secure but consumes high energy
Advantages: High security
Disadvantages: High power consumption, slow

2. Proof of Stake (PoS)
•	Used in: Ethereum (after Merge)
•	Validators are selected based on amount of stake
•	Less energy consumption than PoW
Advantages: Energy efficient, faster
Disadvantages: Wealth concentration risk

3. Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
•	Used in: EOS, TRON
•	Token holders vote for delegates
•	Delegates validate transactions
Advantages: Fast and scalable
Disadvantages: More centralized

4. Proof of Authority (PoA)
•	Used in: Private & consortium blockchains
•	Validators are trusted identities
Advantages: High speed, low cost
Disadvantages: Less decentralized

5. Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)
•	Used in: Hyperledger Sawtooth
•	Validators wait for random time periods
•	First to finish waiting creates block
Advantages: Energy efficient
Disadvantages: Requires trusted hardware

6. Proof of Capacity (PoC)
•	Uses storage space instead of computing power
•	More disk space = higher chance to mine
Advantages: Energy efficient
Disadvantages: Storage heavy

7. Proof of Burn (PoB)
•	Coins are destroyed (burned)
•	Burning proves long-term commitment
Advantages: Prevents energy waste
Disadvantages: Loss of assets

8. Proof of History (PoH)
•	Used in: Solana
•	Cryptographic timestamps prove order of events
Advantages: Very fast
Disadvantages: Complex design

9. Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)
•	Used in: Enterprise blockchains
•	Nodes reach agreement even if some fail
Advantages: High throughput
Disadvantages: Limited scalability

Summary 
Consensus algorithms ensure trust, security, and agreement in blockchain networks without a central authority.
