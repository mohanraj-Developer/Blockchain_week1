STABLECOIN

1. What is Stablecoin?
A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a stable asset such as:
Fiat currency (USD, INR)

Stablecoins reduce the price volatility commonly seen in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Stablecoins solve this problem by providing price stability while retaining blockchain benefits.
