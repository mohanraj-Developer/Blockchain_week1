Remix IDE  
•	Ethereum development environment used to build Ethereum smart contracts and decentralized applications.
•	Common Ethereum development environments:
1.	Truffle – Hardhat platform
2.	Remix – Platform
•	Truffle: Development environment, testing frame, asset, pipeline for EVM based blockchain.
Hardhat is developer Environment. 
•	Remix: Free, Open-source web & desktop application it promotes a quick development cycle and include a large number. 
•	Used to write Solidity smart contracts.
________________________________________
Features of Remix IDE
•	SMART CONTRACT server
•	Custom Browser for Ethereum network
•	SMART CONTRACT testing
•	SMART CONTRACT debugging
•	SMART CONTRACT deployment
________________________________________
Remix IDE – Installation & Setup
•	Install Remix IDE:
o	Command: npm install remix-ide -g
o	URL: https://remix.ethereum.org/
•	File extension: .sol
________________________________________
Ethereum Network
•	Networks are different environments for developers for testing and deploying various dApps.
o	Mainnet: Actual Ethereum network where transactions have real value.
o	Testnet: Networks used for testing and development before deploying to mainnet.
•	This network allows developers to test and deploy applications without using real money.
•	After testing and debugging, smart contracts can be deployed to the mainnet.
________________________________________
Test Network:
	Provide few test networks for developer to test protocol smart contract features and application before deploying then to production network. 
Faucet
•	Used in test networks to provide free test crypto for development and testing.
Public Testnets:
1.	Garli – Most commonly used testnet
2.	Kovan – Running on Ethereum
3.	Rinkely – Running on Geth client
4.	Ropsten – Test network for Ethereum
________________________________________
Ethereum Wallets
•	Help in connecting with Ethereum Blockchain networks.
•	Used for storing and performing monetary transaction tokens from one account to another.
Types
•	Web
•	Desktop
•	Mobile
•	Hardware
________________________________________

MetaMask
•	Web wallet that allows users to send and receive Ether and other Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies.
•	Acts as a gateway to interact with dApps.
•	Keeps private keys secure and uses randomly generated seed phrases.
•	Supports multiple networks and browsers.
•	Can act as mainnet, testnet, or local network connection.
________________________________________Development & Deployment Flow
1.	Create a new test network for development.
2.	Write smart contract code in Solidity.
3.	Compile the contract.
4.	Deploy the code to the network.
5.	Interact with deployed smart contracts using front-end or tools.
________________________________________
Deployment Architecture
•	Deploy using Remix.
•	Use application binary interface (ABI) for interaction.
•	Bridge to connect to network (Ethereum).
•	HTML front end ↔ Ethers.js/Web3.js ↔ Backend.
________________________________________
Smart Contract
Smart Contract Life Cycle
1.	Development
o	Use Solidity as the first phase.
2.	ABI & Bytecode Conversion
o	Smart contract converted into bytecode and ABI.
3.	Deployment
o	Bytecode and ABI deployed on blockchain network.
4.	Contract Interaction
o	Once deployed, other users can interact using the contract address.
________________________________________

Solidity
•	High-level object-oriented programming language.
•	Used for creating smart contracts.
•	Specifically designed for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
•	Version example: Solidity ^0.8.0
________________________________________
Basic Contract Structure
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TestContract {
    string name;

    function setName(string memory _name) public {
        name = _name;
    }

    function getName() public view returns (string memory) {
        return name;
    }
}
________________________________________
Key Concepts
•	Contract: Keyword that defines a smart contract.
•	Memory: Temporary storage.
•	Storage: Permanent storage.
•	public: Visibility keyword.
Functions
•	setName()
o	Accepts a string parameter.
o	Stores it in variable name.
•	getName()
o	Returns the stored string value.
________________________________________
Summary
•	Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform for building smart contracts and dApps.
•	Remix IDE is a key tool for development and testing.
•	MetaMask is used for wallet interaction.
•	Testnets help in safe testing before mainnet deployment.
•	Smart contracts follow development → compile → deploy → interact lifecycle.
